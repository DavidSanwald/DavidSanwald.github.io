I'm so happy with my new bass right now, I had to post some pictures.
It's a 5-string Marcus Miller V7 Swamp-Ash with maple neck and it's the first bass I own.
Maybe I will record something as soon as my playing matches the beauty of the bass (;
But I guess this could take some time and maybe it will even cost me some bleeding fingers (;
