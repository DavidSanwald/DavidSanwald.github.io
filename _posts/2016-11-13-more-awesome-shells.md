My dear friend [Alexandra](http://alexandra-reichart.com/) plays in a new [band](https://www.facebook.com/dieLeckmuscheln/) and I instantly fell in love with it as it is the case with nearly everything she creates or co-creates.

So I just had to share it. Think this band could be my [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) of Dada-Pop.
Something I instantly fell in love with because it just feels good and makes life easier. In some way it's exactly as oh-my-zsh <3
