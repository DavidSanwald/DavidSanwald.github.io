## Thanks for reviewing my application!

Coming from mechanical engineering, I currently don't have extensive web development experience to show in a portfolio.
But I decided to link to 3 recent examples, of things where I learned or shared something. I consider learning or sharing my enjoyment of something with others a great privilege.
At the first glance there may be nothing directly related to an internship position at ESPI but I hope these examples could display my general attitude towards writing code and being persistent until something finally works.

1. This week I [wrote][1] about how to implement some reinforcement learning agent based on recently published advances in AI. The complete code is also on [Github][4].
2. I started working on [this][2] Jupyter notebook{% fn %} explaining the basic mechanics of reinforcement learning.
3. [Here][3] I wrote the steps down, when I finally got NVIDA CUDA drivers to work with Google's Tensorflow and OpenAI Gym on an AWS EC2 instance after a few nights trying many different approaches. To be honest this is the most boring thing ever but I think it's a good example for not giving up even when it means night after night fighting with bad NVIDIA drivers on a linux server.

Furthermore I began to put increasing efforts on catching up with web related technologies.

      <p>I think that Jupyter notebooks could help to teach math, programming and general sciences at universities and schools if they found better adoption. This is why I tried to show off their ability to mix program code and explanations in an accessible manner. There's also an interactive, web executable <a href="https://mybinder.org/repo/davidsanwald/ai-notebook">version</a> in a Docker container.</p>
