I just couldn't resist as beginning this small blog with the classic "Hello world!" and also some functional life advice:

![Functional way of life!](/img/laziness.jpg) %}

This seems very appropriate because it is the classical learning example. And because I'm a soon to be mechanical engineering graduate striving to learn how to write good code and do something with it, this blog will be from my perspective as a learner.
As I don't know if anything I'll write about will be of interest for anyone else but me I'm starting this blog mainly to organize my thoughts and keep track of my journey as a learner. I can imagine my future me someday reading a few posts in this blog and laughing about how stupid I have been back then.
Maybe "someday" will already be next week :)
I really like John D. Cook's blog and I think the absolut worst "Hello world" ever he discovered in [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556153953/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1556153953&linkCode=as2&tag=theende-20&linkId=6NLKFFPXQOB2C7OA) book about Win 3.1 programming is really worth a [look](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/11/12/hello-world-is-the-hard-part/).
